                        <p>
                            Created in a team of four for a 2D Game Design course, we all worked together from the initial conception 
                            to the final prototype using Agile design methodology. My skills in both art and programming allowed me 
                            to help whenever needed and gave me a better idea on how to prepare art assets to use within the Ren’Py engine. 
                        </p>

                        <h3> <u>Grandma Babushka:</u> </h3>
                        <p>
                            Originally we had planned for a fullbody view of characters, but eventually decided to reduce it to headshots 
                            for the sake of time and resources. Our protagonist was meant to be a sweet, slightly sassy, and classic 
                            babushka who loves her tea in contrast to the dark fantasy aesthetic of her world. Both designs were different 
                            takes on a headscarf and large coat to keep her warm in the forest she explores, with a kind smile in her eyes. 
                            A headshot can only show so much, so I tried to show her age through her rounded face, creases, and slightly 
                            stooped figure. I thought the small glasses also gave her a more grandmotherly vibe.

                            After playing around with different colours, I decided on a mainly warm palette with a blue headscarf for 
                            contrast. Many of the references I found sported colourful floral patterns. The high-resolution pixel art 
                            style helps to soften Granny’s appearance. We decided on seven different expressions to accompany all dialogue, 
                            although we weren’t able to get far enough to utilize the tea expression. This was my first time with pixel art 
                            and I had to be very particular with pixel placements, because anything off would be glaringly obvious. 
                        </p>

                        <h3> <u>Ren'Py Engine:</u> </h3>
                        <p>
                            This was my first time working with the Ren’Py game engine which I was able to catch on to quickly. Our hidden 
                            object puzzle used Ren’Py’s Screen functions to create image maps that allowed the user to investigate our burnt 
                            hut scene. While figuring out how to implement it I was able to optimize our art assets and smooth out potential 
                            issues we had. As the lead programmer, I was in charge of laying down the foundations and overseeing changes, 
                            making sure they were integrated well in our GitHub repository. I also helped tackle bugs that other members were 
                            having trouble with. However, our inventory system was created entirely by our amazing member Arteya.

                        I was able to seamlessly overlay these edited screenshots over the original background for a hover effect and 
                        allow the player to click the drawer like a button thanks to the image map.
